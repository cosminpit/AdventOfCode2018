# Advent of code 2018 - Christmas puzzles

Christmas is comming and programming is always fun. From Dec 1st to Dec 25th, a puzzle consisting of two parts is released every day ([https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)) and I'll be trying to solve them consistently, 25 days in a row, every morning, and hopefully fast enough to collect some points on the leaderboard.
